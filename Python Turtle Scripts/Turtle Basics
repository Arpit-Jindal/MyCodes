import turtle               # allows us to use the turtles library
wn = turtle.Screen()        # creates a graphics window
alex = turtle.Turtle()      # create a turtle named alex
alex.forward(150)           # tell alex to move forward by 150 units
alex.left(90)               # turn by 90 degrees
alex.forward(75)            # complete the second side of a rectangle

wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")        # set the window background color

alex.stamp()                # leave an impression on the canvas
A turtle can “stamp” its footprint onto the canvas, and this will remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else. Stamping works even when the pen is up.


tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")              # make tess blue
tess.pensize(3)                 # set the width of her pen
wn.exitonclick()                # wait for a user click on the canvas

alex.up()
alex.forward(100)     # this moves alex, but no line is drawn
alex.down()

alex.shape("turtle") #Every turtle can have its own shape. The ones available “out of the box” are arrow, blank, circle, classic, square, triangle, turtle.
------------------
You can speed up or slow down the turtle’s animation speed. (Animation controls how quickly the turtle turns and moves forward). Speed settings can be set between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest). But if you set the speed to 0, it has a special meaning — turn off animation and go as fast as possible.

alex.speed(10)
